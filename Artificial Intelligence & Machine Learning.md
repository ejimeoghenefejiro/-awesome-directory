#### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) involve creating systems that can learn from data, make decisions, or perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

**Fundamentals**

- [Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera by Andrew Ng)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - by Andrew Ng. Highly recommended for understanding deep learning concepts.
- [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. A classic textbook on statistical learning.
- [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) - by Google. Hands-on ML with video lectures and exercises.
